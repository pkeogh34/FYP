Predicting Protein Disorder Using Evolutionary Scale Modeling
Overview
This project focuses on the prediction of protein disorder, a crucial aspect of understanding protein functions and interactions in bioinformatics. The unique approach of this study involves using evolutionary scale modeling to enhance prediction accuracy. The project comprises a comparative analysis: initially running models with a modern formatted set of proteins and subsequently applying evolutionary scale modeling for improved predictions.

Features
Implementation of machine learning models for protein disorder prediction.
Use of a modern dataset of proteins for initial predictions.
Application of evolutionary scale modeling to enhance prediction accuracy.
Comparative analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of evolutionary scale modeling.
